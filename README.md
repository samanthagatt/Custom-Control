# Custom `UIControl`

Your project creates a new custom control that allows users to rate items by swiping a finger along a row of stars. This project helps you practice the concepts learned in Lambda's iOS module 6.2.

After completing the lesson material and ht is project, you'll be able to subclass UIControl to develop custom interactions.

## Set up the Project

Follow these steps to set up your project skeleton:

1. Create a new single-view project. 
1. Drag a navigation controller into the `Main.storyboard`. 
1. Delete the default table view controller.
1. Make your view controller the root view for the navigation controller.
1. Make your navigation controller the entry point for the project by setting it as the initial view controller.

## Create a new custom control class

These steps walk you through creating the new control class and adding an instance in Interface Builder:

1. Create a new Swift file using File > New File. Name it CustomControl.swift.
2. In the file, import UIKit and create a new type (called `CustomControl`) that you subclass from `UIControl`.
3. Add a new Int-typed variable property called `value` to your class. It's initial value should be 1.
3. In Interface builder, add a new view. You can change the background color in the Attributes Inspector so it's visible.
4. Center it with Auto Layout but don't worry about the size.
5. Use the Identity Inspector to set the class to Custom Control.
6. In the Size Inspector, select Ambiguity > Verify Position Only.
7. Use Ctrl-drag to connect your view to ViewController.swift. Add a new action and call it `updateRating`. 
8. Edit the new method's signature to: `@IBAction func updateRating(_ ratingControl: CustomControl)`. This keeps you from having to cast the `sender` to the right class.
9. Implement `updateRating`. When called, it sets the view controller's title to the string `"User Rating: N stars"` where N is the number of stars. This number is the control's visible `value` property.
10. **Stretch**: Fix the title so it's correct for 1 ("star" not "stars") as well as 2-5.

## Build the control view

Custom controls are often fixed size (although they may use different sizes on iPhone and iPad targets). You'll build a control that consists of five labels, build without Auto Layout. All this work takes place in your CustomControl.swift file.

1. Create the following private constants for your class: `componentDimension`, a CGFloat equal to 40.0, `componentCount`, equal to 5, `componentActiveColor`, which is `UIColor.black`, and `componentInactiveColor`, which is `UIColor.gray`.
2. Add an `init?(coder aCoder: NSCoder)` initializer. After calling `super`, have it call a `setup()` function, which is where you'll perform your setup work.
3.	In `setup`, create five labels and add them as subviews. You'll probably want to keep an array pointing to them so they're easily available for lookup.
4. Add a tag for each view that represents which star it is. The first star is tag 1. The fifth is tag 5. The tags let you quickly update the control's value. 
5. Set each label's frame to size `componentDimension` by `componentDimension`. (Yes, they are all square). Lay out the labels in a row, with 8 points of space between each one. The first label should be at (0, 0). The next one starts at (componentDimension + 8.0, 0.0), and so forth.
6. Set the font (bold system font, size 32.0), text (pick your favorite Unicode star from the character picker), and alignment (center) for your label. 
7. Set their `textColor` to either the active (for the first) or inactive (for the others) component color.
8. Add the following method to your type. This method tells Auto Layout how big your custom control should be.

```
override var intrinsicContentSize: CGSize {
  let componentsWidth = CGFloat(componentCount) * componentDimension
  let componentsSpacing = CGFloat(componentCount + 1) * 8.0
  let width = componentsWidth + componentsSpacing
  return CGSize(width: width, height: componentDimension)
}
```

Test and run your application to make sure your control is visible and that the stars are laid out as expected.

## Add touch handlers.

Follow these steps to add touch to your control class. These handler implementations are almost identical to the ones in your guided project. You'll be adding:

* `beginTracking(_ touch: UITouch, with event: UIEvent?) -> Bool`
* `continueTracking(_ touch: UITouch, with event: UIEvent?) -> Bool`
* `endTracking(_ touch: UITouch?, with event: UIEvent?)`
* `cancelTracking(with event: UIEvent?)`

1. Add skeletons for `begin`, `continue`, `end`, and `cancel` tracking methods. The `begin` and `continue` methods should just return true.
2. Add a skeleton for an `updateValue(at touch: UITouch)` method.
3. In `cancel`, send an action for `.touchCancel`
4. In `begin`, add `updateValue()` to respond to the start of your user's touch.
5. In `continue`, check whether the touch is inside view bounds. Send either `.touchDragInside` or `.touchDragOutside`. If the touch is inside, update your value with `updateValue()`.
6. In `end`, make sure you still have a valid touch and return if not. Otherwise, check whether the touch is inside view bounds and duplicate the logic for `continue`. Replace the two actions with `touchUpInside` and `touchUpOutside` instead of the drag forms you used for `continue`.

## Respond to touches.

Follow these steps to finish up your control and add user feedback.

1. In `updateValue`, you handle touches by checking to see whether they intersect with any of your stored label subviews. Implement a loop that iterates through your component labels and detect whether each touch's location (`touch.location(in: self)`) is contained in each label's frame.
2. When a touch overlaps a label, set the control's value to that tag, update the label colors to reflect the current touch, and send an action for `valueChanged`.
3. **Stretch** It's better to store the old value before changing it and only send an update when the value has changed.
4. **Stretch** Add the following `UIView` animation to flare the view a little when selected.

```
extension UIView {
  // "Flare view" animation sequence
  func performFlare() {
    func flare()   { transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 1.6, y: 1.6) }
    func unflare() { transform = .identity }
    
    UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3,
                   animations: { flare() },
                   completion: { _ in UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.1) { unflare() }})
  }
}
``` 

## Test
1. Run the project and make sure everything works.
2. If anything doesn't work the way the video shows (outside of the two stretch goals), go back and debug your issues.
3. As always, if you need help, follow the 20-minute rule, then ask your PM.

## Go Farther
Time allowing, here are some things you can try.

1. Change the number of buttons to allow 4 or 6 star rating controls. Does everything work right with your change being in a single line of code?
2. Flip the control for use in right-to-left language countries, where you slide from right to left.
3. Create different flare animations. Things you can animate include background color, translucency (the view's `alpha` property), and rotation. You'll be able to find examples of these with simple web searches.
